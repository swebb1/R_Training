# Outline 

The ggplot2 (grammar for graphics) package provides a flexible and powerful set of functions to create useful and visually appealing graphics. However for a beginner, the wealth of options can be overwhelming. The goal of this tutorial is to help you learn the basic syntax of each element you need to add and to create professional looking graphics. Useful libraries that provide additional functionality are also introduced.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to:

* Format, filter and manipulate your datasets in preparation for plotting 
* Understand the reason and methods for long and wide data formats
* Understand how to create different types of graphics by applying geometries
* Apply additional layers to a graphic
* Visually subset the graphic by applying fills and gradients 
* Change the appearance of the graphic by using themes
* Create sub-graphics by applying facets 
* Create and save basic graphics
* Use additional libraries such as plotly to enhance the utility of the graphic. 

# Getting started

* Create a new project in RStudio
* It will be best to work with the tutorial and RStudio open together so you can easily switch between the two. Working on a wide split screen should be the best setup.
* I recommend typing out the commands rather than copy and paste if you want to learn!

You can work in 3 different ways in RStudio. Use the **console** to run commands, create a new **R script** to save your commands as you go, or create an **R markdown** file to generate a final report.

# Library Install and Usage

Libraries provide additional functions in R and can be downloaded from a network of servers called the Comprehensive R Archive Network [CRAN].

Installing packages:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("PACKAGENAME")
#Today we will use the following packages
#Please ensure that are installed before attending the session
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "ggthemes", "plotly","ggpubr", "ggrepel","viridis","RColorBrewer","ggsci","tidyverse"))
```

To use libraries from the various packages, use the "library" function. These are the packages that we will use today.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(plotly)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggpubr)
library(viridis)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(ggsci)
```

# Tidyverse

The **tidyverse** is actually a suite of packages that includes **ggplot2**. These packages are designed for data science and share underlying principles, grammar and data structures. There are many ways to do the same thing in R, but following the philosophy of *tidy data* and using the *tidyverse* packages will keep your datasets organised and make analysis easier in the long run. There are [cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) available for many tidyverse and rstudio packages that will help you to choose the correct functions.

## Tidy data

Data can be represented in many different ways across multiple tables but the tidyverse packages are specifically designed to work with **tidy** datasets. Tidy data conforms to the following:

* Each variable has it's own column
* Each row is a single observation
* Each value has it's own cell

![](Pictures/tidy.png)

This is the optimal structure when working in R and provides consistency amongst your datasets. Getting your data into R and wrangling it into the correct format is always the first step in your analysis. Fortunately, the **tidyr** package contains many functions to *tidy* up your dataset.

We will start by reading in a dataset. The *readr* package has functions for importing data as tibbles. Tibbles are the tidyverse compatible version of an R data.frame.

```{r, results = 'hide'}
#If you already have the data installed you can read from the file
#surveys <- read_csv("data/surveys_complete.csv")

#Otherwise read from the URL
surveys <- read_csv("http://bifx-core.bio.ed.ac.uk/training/R_dplyr_and_ggplot2/data/surveys_complete.csv")

```

This dataset contains observations from a field survey of different organisms at different sites (plots). Let's inspect the data.

```{r, eval=F}
#Type an R objects name to print the contents
surveys
```

```{r, eval=F}
#Use the View function
View(surveys)
```

```{r, eval=F}
#We can look at the structure of the dataset
str(surveys)
```

# Data manipulation (dplyr)

The **dplyr** package is specifically designed for data formatting and manipulation and allows you to merge datasets, create new columns, filter and summarise your data. We are going to learn some of the most common functions.

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument
to this function is the data frame (`surveys`), and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r, eval=F, purl = FALSE}
select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)
```

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a "-" in front of
the variable to exclude it.

```{r, eval=F, purl = FALSE}
select(surveys, -record_id, -species_id)
```

This will select all the variables in `surveys` except `record_id`
and `species_id`.

To choose rows based on a specific criteria, use `filter()`:

```{r, eval=F,purl = FALSE}
filter(surveys, year == 1995)
```

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use
that as input to the next function, like this:

```{r, eval=F, purl = FALSE}
surveys2 <- filter(surveys, weight < 5)
surveys_sml <- select(surveys2, species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:

```{r, eval=F, purl = FALSE}
surveys_sml <- select(filter(surveys, weight < 5), species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take
the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful
when you need to do many things to the same dataset.  Pipes in R look like
`%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, installed automatically with **`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.

```{r, eval=F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
```

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `surveys` dataset first through `filter()` to keep rows where `weight` is less than 5, then through `select()` to keep only the `species_id`, `sex`, and `weight` columns. Since `%>%` takes the object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance, in the above example, we took the data frame `surveys`, *then* we `filter`ed for rows with `weight < 5`, *then* we `select`ed columns `species_id`, `sex`, and `weight`. The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat simple, but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we
can assign it a new name:

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
surveys_sml <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
surveys_sml
```

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

> surveys %>%
>     filter(year < 1995) %>%
>     select(year, sex, weight)
> ```
> </details>

## Exporting data

Similar to the `read_csv()` function there is also a `write_csv()` function. If you want to export any of your newly created datasets you can do this as follows:

```{r, eval=F}
write_csv(surveys_sml, path = "data/surveys_small.csv")
```

## Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two columns. For this we use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:

```{r, eval=F,,purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000)
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:

```{r, eval=F,, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000,
         weight_lb = weight_kg * 2.2)
```

If you just want to see the first few rows, you can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data. 

```{r, eval=F,purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

>     filter(hindfoot_cm < 3) %>%
>     select(species_id, hindfoot_cm)
> ```
> </details>

## Split-apply-combine

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.

### Summarise and group_by

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses each group into a single-row summary of that group. `group_by()` takes as arguments the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the mean `weight` by sex:

```{r, eval=F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

You can also group by multiple columns:

```{r, eval=F,purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a column indicating the minimum weight for each species for each sex:

```{r, eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))
```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the values. For instance, we can sort on `min_weight` to put the lighter species first:

```{r, eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(min_weight)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we want to sort the results by decreasing order of mean weight:

```{r, eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_weight))
```


### Count

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **`dplyr`** provides `count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for each sex, we would do:

```{r, eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
    count(sex) 
```

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen: grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of observations in that group. In other words, `surveys %>% count(sex)` is equivalent to:  

```{r, eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
    group_by(sex) %>%
    summarise(count = n())
```

For convenience, `count()` provides the `sort` argument:  

```{r, eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
    count(sex, sort = TRUE) 
```

Previous example shows the use of `count()` to count the number of rows/observations 
for *one* factor (i.e., `sex`). 
If we wanted to count *combination of factors*, such as `sex` and `species`, 
we would specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:

```{r eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species) 
```

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table according to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison. For instance, we might want to arrange the table above in (i) an alphabetical order of the levels of the species and (ii) in descending order of the count:

```{r eval = F, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species) %>%
  arrange(species, desc(n))
```

From the table above, we may learn that, for instance, there are 75 observations of 
the *albigula* species that are not specified for its sex (i.e. `NA`).

## Spreading and gathering

The **tidyr** package contains the functions `spread()` and `gather()` which allow you to transform a dataset between *long* and *wide* formats. For instance, what if we wanted to compare the mean weights of each species at each plot (using plot_id). 

We'd need to create a new table where each row is comprised of values of variables associated with each plot. In practical terms this means the values in `genus` would become the names of column variables and the cells would contain the values of the mean weight observed on each plot.

![](Pictures/spread_data_R.png)

Having created a new table, it is then straightforward to explore the relationship between the weight of different genera within, and between, the plots. The key point here is that we are still following a tidy data structure,but we have **reshaped** the data according to the observation of interest. Mean genus weight per plot, instead of recordings per date.

First, lets create `surveys_gw` where observations for each plot (genus and mean_weight) are spread across multiple rows: 

```{r, results="hide",purl=FALSE}
surveys_gw <- surveys %>%
  group_by(plot_id, genus) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

Using `spread()` with `genus` as key and `mean_weight` as value we can create a table that allows us to compare mean weights of different genera at each plot. 

```{r, eval=F, purl=FALSE}
surveys_spread <- surveys_gw %>%
  spread(key = genus, value = mean_weight)
```

The opposing situation could occur if we had been provided with data in the form of `surveys_spread`, where the genus names are column names, but we wish to treat them as values of a variable instead. To do this we can use the `gather()` function.

# Data visualisation (ggplot2)

`ggplot2` is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots from data in a data frame. It provides a grammar for specifying which variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties. Therefore, we only need minimal changes to our code if the underlying data change or if we decide to switch from a bar plot to a scatterplot. This helps to create publication quality plots with minimal adjustments and tweaking.

ggplot graphics are built step by step by adding new elements. Adding *layers* in this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots.

To build a ggplot, we use the following basic template:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```

### Fisher's Iris dataset (pre-installed in R)

![iris](Pictures/iris.png)

Fisher examined the length and width of the petals and sepals in irises to determine a classification algorithm. Here we will explore the relationship between species and the dimension of the flowers via the ggplot2 plotting package.  Fisher's data is stored as a built in data set in R. To see the data type:

```{r}
head(iris)
```

This data frame has two types of data, continuous and discrete.
 
```{r}
str(iris)
```

The continuous data is of type number and the distrete data is of type factor, which can be one of the 3 species:

```{r}
levels(iris$Species)
```

## Creating a ggplot

Let's explore this dataset with ggplot.

1. use the ggplot() function and bind the plot to a specific data frame using the data argument.

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris)
```

2. define a mapping (using the aesthetic (aes) function), by selecting the variables to be plotted and specifying how to present them in the graph, e.g. as x/y positions or characteristics such as size, shape, color, etc.

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
```


3. add ‘geoms’ – graphical representations of the data in the plot (points, lines, bars). ggplot2 offers many different geoms, here are a few commonly used examples:

* `geom_point()` for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
* `geom_histogram()` for histograms
* `geom_bar()` for bar plots
* `geom_boxplot()` for, well, boxplots!
* `geom_line()` for trend lines, time series, etc.

## Scatterplots

To add a geom to the plot use the + operator. Let’s use geom_point() to plot two continuous variables first. The *data* and *mapping* are always the first two arguments to ggplot so we can leave these out if arguments are provided in this order:

```{r}
ggplot(iris,aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point()
```

The `+` in the ggplot2 package is particularly useful because it allows us to modify existing ggplot objects. This means we can easily set up plot templates and conveniently explore different types of plots, so the above plot can also be generated with code like this:

```{r}
# Assign plot to a variable
p <- ggplot(data = iris, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))

# Draw a scatter plot
p + geom_point()
```

Anything you put in the `ggplot()` function is inherited by the subsequent geom layers that you add. This includes the x- and y-axis mapping you set up in `aes()`. If you want to specify mappings for a given geom independently you can add these within a geom.

We can colour the points in the geometry.
```{r}
p + geom_point(colour="red")
```

Not very informative though, let's start again and colour the points by species. Note as well that the x and y labels are also not neccessary if the data is in the correct order.

```{r}
p<-ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, colour=Species) ) +  geom_point()
p
```

In the `aes()` function, `colour` is used for lines and points. If you want to colour shapes such as bars in barplots and histograms you need to use `fill`.

Each function within the ggplot package has its own help file associated with it.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?geom_point()
```

Note that all the geometries also define a statistical transformation. In the help file of geom_point you'll see that `stat = "identity"` which is just the value that is presented. Other geometries have different defaults, for instance `geom_histogram` bins values together.

## Histograms

Here is an example of the histogram geometry:

```{r}
#Create a new version of the iris dataset with a new column
iris2<- iris %>% mutate(Sepal.Ratio=Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width)
#Visualise the distribution of Sepal.Ratio with a histogram
h<- ggplot(iris2, aes(Sepal.Ratio, fill=Species )) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=0.1)
h
```

Try altering the `binwidth` parameter to see how this affects the plot.

> Is this the best way to visualise this data?

## Boxplots

Boxplots are an effective way to visualise distributions of data within groups. The boxplot geometry needs the x value to be a categorical variable. 

```{r}
b <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Width )) +  geom_boxplot() 
b
```

To change the axes we can use another function called coord_flip()

```{r}
b + coord_flip()
```

We can reorder the `Species` by the median `Sepal.Width` for display purposes. The **forcats** package in the **tidyverse** has lots of functions for ordering, labelling and manipulating factors (discrete / categorical variables).

```{r}
b <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=fct_reorder(Species,Sepal.Width), y=Sepal.Width )) + 
  geom_boxplot()
b
```

We probably want to relabel the x-axis now:

```{r}
b <- b + xlab("Species")
b
```

What if we want to plot all of the values per species as a boxplot? We can add multiple boxplot geoms to a plot but it doesn't really work as in informative graphic:

```{r}
ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Species, y=Petal.Width)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Species, y=Petal.Length))
```

The problem is that our different variables (Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width etc.) exist in different columns. There is no way to separate these along the x-axis or to colour them differently. 

Our data is currently in "wide" format and each row represents an observation for one flower. We need to transform the data into "long" format so that each column header becomes a value. We can use the `gather()` function in **tidyr** to do this.

```{r}
#Key is the name of the column that defines a variable
#Value is the name of the value for that variable
#We use "-Species" as we want to gather all of the columns except Species.
iris.long <- gather(iris,key = Flower.Part , value = Value,-Species)
head(iris.long)
```

Now it is easy to create the boxplot we wanted. 

```{r} 
ggplot(iris.long, aes(Species, Value, fill=Flower.Part)) + geom_boxplot()
```


## Adding layers

By adding points to a boxplot, we can have a better idea of the number of measurements and of their distribution.  
 
```{r}
b + geom_point(colour="forest green")
```

This is okay, but there are some blurry dots where values overlap and it's difficult to see how many data points we really have. We can use the `alpha` option within our geometry to increase transparency.

```{r}
b + geom_point(colour="forest green",alpha=0.3)
```

This is slightly better, we can see that darker points have more overlap, but it isn't great. `geom_jitter` is a good alternative to `geom_point` in this example as it shifts data points so that they don't overlap. We will colour by Species so there is no confusion.

```{r}
b + geom_jitter(aes(colour=Species))
```

## Violin plots

## Themes

Recap: 
```{r}
p<-ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, colour=Species)) +  geom_point()
```

We can continue to modify this plot. Let's make the axis a bit prettier with the xlab() and ylab() functions: 

```{r, error=T}
p <- p + xlab('Sepal length') + ylab('Sepal width') 
p
```

All the characteristics of the plot, such as text size and the background are managed by the function called theme().  To see what a theme can change: 
```{r}
?theme
```

You can use a theme with predefined defaults e.g:

```{r}
p + theme_dark()
p + theme_bw()
```

You can also try `theme_light`, `theme_minimal`, `theme_void`, or create you own from scratch:

```{r}
p + theme(
    		panel.background = element_blank(), 
     		panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "darkgrey"), 
     		text = element_text(size=20), 
     		axis.title.x=element_blank(), 
     		axis.title.y=element_blank()
    		)
# Note you can save your theme and reuse it 
theme_for_nature <- theme(
    		panel.background = element_blank(), 
     		panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "darkgrey"), 
     		text = element_text(size=20), 
     		axis.title.x=element_blank(), 
     		axis.title.y=element_blank() 
    		)
```

We can then reuse a theme, for example on the histogram we made earlier.
```{r}
h + theme_for_nature
```

R-studio will offer help finding themes after typing "theme_". Give some of them a try. The **ggthemes** and **ggpubr** packages also contain a selection of prebuilt themes e.g:

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
p + theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

We can set a default theme to use in all ggplots: 
```{r}
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

## Adding colours to plots

As we have seen, points, lines and shapes can be coloured by a value in your dataframe using the `aes()` function. Earlier we coloured by a factor but we can also colour by a continuous value which will create a gradient of colour. 

Lets look at the Petals this time and colour by the ratio of Sepal.Length to Sepal.Width:

```{r}
q <- ggplot(iris2, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, colour=Sepal.Ratio)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5)
q
```

To change the colours we need to use the `scale_color_*` functions of which there are many. Some are built into **ggplot2** and others exist in external packages such as **viridis** or **ggthemes**. 

The [viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) and [ColorBrewer](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/the-a-z-of-rcolorbrewer-palette/) palettes are particularly useful and worth investigating. The [ggsci](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggsci/vignettes/ggsci.html) package contains palletes based on key scientific journals.

### Continuous scales

```{r}
#default
q + scale_colour_continuous()
#ColorBrewer palletes (many to choose from)
q + scale_colour_distiller(palette = "Spectral")
#Viridis colour scales (many to choose from)
q + scale_colour_viridis()
```

An alternative method is to use the `scale_colour_gradient*` functions to define your own gradient e.g:

```{r}
q + scale_color_gradient2(high="darkred", low="white",  mid="red", midpoint=2, space="Lab")
```

### Discrete scales

There are also colour scales for discrete variables. Note that we must use `fill` for colouring boxes.

```{r}
bp<- ggplot(iris2,aes(Species,Sepal.Length,fill=Species)) +
  geom_boxplot()
#Default
bp + scale_fill_discrete()
#Viridis
bp + scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
#ColorBrewer Palettes
bp + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
#GGSci - Nature publishing group
bp + scale_fill_npg()
```

Alternatively you can manually choose your own colours:

```{r}
h + scale_fill_manual(values = c("forest green","dodger blue", "firebrick"))
```

The options for colouring graphs are huge.  The help pages for many of the functions will refer to the general help page for that package. [Color brewer 2](http://colorbrewer2.org) is a great site for getting the hex values of colours to suit needs such as printer or colour blind friendliness.

## Adding more variables

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(iris2, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, colour=Sepal.Ratio)) +
  geom_line()
```

## Faceting 

When we have defined groups within a dataset of many values, we can split our data into separate plots by using `facets`. 

Let's look at plot q again 
```{r}
q
```

Let's split this plot by species. This is achieved using either the `facet_grid()` or `facet_wrap()` functions. Try playing around with the nrow and scales parameters in `facet_wrap()`.

```{r}
q + facet_wrap(~Species,nrow = 1,scales = "fixed")
```

The `facet_grid()` function is useful when you are splitting by multiple factors. For instance, let's add a country column to `iris2` by randomly assigning one of four nations of origin to each observation:

```{r}
countries <- c("Italy", "Spain", "France", "UK")
#Sample will randomly select a value for each row
iris2 <- iris2 %>% mutate(Country=sample(countries,nrow(iris2),replace=TRUE))

q2 <- ggplot(iris2, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, colour = Sepal.Ratio)) +
  geom_point()
q2 + facet_grid(Country ~ Species)
```

>  ggplot(aes(x=Country, y=Mean, colour=Species)) + geom_point(size=4) + facet_wrap(~Species) + labs(title="Mean Petal Length")
> ```

## Saving plots 

In RStudio there are many options to save the image. However, if you are are wanting to use ggplot2 in a script, or via web interfaces, you can export a graph using the function `ggsave()`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#save a png file 
ggsave("IrisScatterplot.png", p)
##save a pdf file
ggsave("CombinePlot.pdf",p2)
```

The image format is automatically assigned from the file extension you use in the filename. Within `ggsave()` you can also set the resolution for the image as well as the length and width for the image. See the help page for ggsave for more options.

## Arranging multiple plots

Placing ggplots side by side can be performed with packages like **gridExtra** and **patchwork**. [Patchwork](https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork) uses simple formulas to arrange ggplots:

```{r}
library(patchwork)
#On top
q/bp
#Side by side
q+bp
#2 plots on top, 1 on bottom
(q+h)/bp
```

To save:
```{r}
library(patchwork)
#On top
ggsave("DoublePlot.png",q/bp)
```

## Other useful functions

### Cut functions

The `cut_*` functions in ggplot2 can turn continous data into discrete levels. In this example we create a new column that puts the data into 5 groups of equal size based on `Sepal.Length`:

```{r}
iris2 <- iris2 %>% mutate(Sepal.Length.Group=cut_number(Sepal.Length,5))

ggplot(iris2,aes(Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width,fill = Sepal.Length.Group)) +  
  geom_violin() +
  labs(fill="Sepal length intervals", x="Sepal length",y="Sepal width")
```

Note the use of the `labs()` function to change multiple labels at once.

### Scaling data

Let's look at a larger dataset like the `surveys_complete` data we used earlier:

```{r}
ggplot(surveys,aes(weight,hindfoot_length))+geom_point()
```

For axes with large values or very dispersed values it can be useful to rescale using a log axis. This can be done in two ways:

```{r}
##We can transform the values in our ggplot call:
ggplot(surveys,aes(log10(weight),hindfoot_length))+geom_point()
```

```{r}
##OR we can change the axis to a log scale
ggplot(surveys,aes(weight,hindfoot_length))+geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

Can you see the difference in these plots?

### Adding labels

You can add labels to points in your graphs. One of the best ways to do this is to use the package **ggrepel**.

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
# you can use geom_text_repel() or geom_label_repel() to label whatever you want with non-overlapping labels. In the brackets use conditional subsetting to only label the interesting elements of your data.

ggplot(iris2,aes(Petal.Width,Petal.Length,colour=Sepal.Ratio)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label=ifelse(Petal.Length > 6.4 ,as.character(Species),'')))
```

### Interactive graphs with Plotly 

[Plotly](https://plot.ly/ggplot2) for ggplot2 is a browser-based charting library that converts ggplots into interactive visualisations:

```{r}
library(plotly)
p2<-ggplot(iris2,aes(Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width,colour=Species))+geom_point()
ggplotly(p)
```

By default the mouse over text is what is mapped in the aesthetics. You can add a `text` aesthetic to add this to the tooltip text. 

```{r,warning=F}
p2<- p2+ geom_point(aes(text=Country))
ggplotly(p2)

```

## Creating detailed graphics with ggpubr

The **ggpubr** package provides wrapper functions for ggplot that make it easier to generate complex, publication ready graphics. It includes functions for running statistical tests and displaying the results in the plot. After using ggpubr, you will need to reset your theme with `theme_set()`.

```{r, warning=F}
# Violin plots with box plots inside
data("ToothGrowth")
df <- ToothGrowth

my_comparisons <- list( c("0.5", "1"), c("1", "2"), c("0.5", "2") )

ggviolin(df, x = "dose", y = "len", fill = "dose",
         palette = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
         add = "boxplot", add.params = list(fill = "white"))+
  stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comparisons, label = "p.signif")+ # Add significance levels
  stat_compare_means(label.y = 50)                                      # Add global the p-value 
```

```{r}
library(cowplot) 
# Main plot
pmain <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species))+
  geom_point()+
  ggpubr::color_palette("jco")
# Marginal densities along x axis
xdens <- axis_canvas(pmain, axis = "x")+
  geom_density(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species),
              alpha = 0.7, size = 0.2)+
  ggpubr::fill_palette("jco")
# Marginal densities along y axis
# Need to set coord_flip = TRUE, if you plan to use coord_flip()
ydens <- axis_canvas(pmain, axis = "y", coord_flip = TRUE)+
  geom_density(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, fill = Species),
                alpha = 0.7, size = 0.2)+
  coord_flip()+
  ggpubr::fill_palette("jco")
p1 <- insert_xaxis_grob(pmain, xdens, grid::unit(.2, "null"), position = "top")
p2<- insert_yaxis_grob(p1, ydens, grid::unit(.2, "null"), position = "right")
ggdraw(p2)
```
