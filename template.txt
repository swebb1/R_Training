###Key points
<div class="key-points">
<h2><i class="question-circle icon-2x"></i> How to follow this tutorial</h2>
##
 * Create a new project in RStudio
 * Open a new R script (or R markdown file for advanced users)
 * It will be best to work with the tutorial and RStudio open together so you can easily switch between the two. Working on a wide split-screen should be the best setup.
 * I recommend typing out commands rather than copy-and-pasting if you want to learn!
